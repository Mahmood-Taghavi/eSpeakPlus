eSpeakPlus is a collection of the legacy espeak version 1.48.15 Text To Speech (TTS) which supports SAPI 5 speech driver in Windows, the open-sourced Mbrola library, plus some Mbrola voices (ir1; de6; de7; en1; us1; us2; us3), and voice variants including the famous “max” which are defined in the espeak NG project. 
The eSpeakPlus also provides phonetic translation files for two Mbrola diphone databases namely de6 and de7 and definition of mb-de6-fa, mb-de6-en, mb-de7-fa, and mb-de7-en espeak Mbrola voice files which enable espeak to read Persian and English text using the aforementioned German diphones.
